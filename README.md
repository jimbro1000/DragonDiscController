* Dragon 32/64 Disk Controller Card *

This project contains the design and build
documents for a recreation of the DragonDos
disc controller

** Design **

The schematics use a WDC WD2797 disc controller
IC as the core of the board, this is consistent
with the original DragonData design

Other than the rom and controller the discrete
logic chips are surface mount to help with the
availability of components. In all cases the
surface mount parts are of the largest versions
available to try and make the assembly of the
board feasible for hand soldering

** Progress **

In the current state the board is untested

The PCB layout is (very) generous on dimensions
and needs work to shrink it down. Iterating on
this won't change the functionality and should
significantly reduce the size of the board, and
hence the cost of fabrication

** Assembly and BoM **

Until the board progresses to a point where it
can be tested the assembly instructions and the
proven bill of materials are left unpublished
